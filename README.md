#Grid Maker

##Project Description

The Grid Maker application allows users to dynamically create, modify, and interact with a grid on a web page. Users can add and remove rows and columns, select colors to fill grid cells, and clear all cells. The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for grid manipulation, and it provides real-time feedback to the user via alerts and confirmations.

##Features
- Add Rows: Users can add rows to the grid.
- Add Columns: Users can add columns to the grid.
- Remove Rows: Users can remove the last row from the grid.
- Remove Columns: Users can remove the last column from the grid.
- Color a Cell: Users can select a color and apply it to an individual grid cell by clicking on it.
- Fill All Uncolored Cells: Users can fill all uncolored cells with the selected color. If no uncolored cells remain, the system will alert: "No more uncolored boxes to fill!"
- Fill All Cells: Users can fill all cells with the selected color, with a confirmation prompt.
- Clear All Cells: Users can clear all colored cells with a confirmation prompt.
- Real-time Feedback: Users receive alerts for specific actions (e.g., no color selected, no more rows or columns to remove).
